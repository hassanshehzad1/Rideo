Rideo is a ride-sharing app where users can book rides by selecting their pickup, destination, and vehicle type, while captains can accept and manage ride requests. The app uses a microservices setup to handle different functionalities, ensuring scalability. Real-time features like ride notifications and location updates are powered by WebSockets, and RabbitMQ handles asynchronous events like ride creation.

Frontend: Built with React + Vite, styled with Tailwind CSS, and animated with GSAP.
Backend: Node.js with Express, MongoDB for data storage, and JWT for authentication.
Communication: REST APIs, RabbitMQ for events, and Socket.IO for real-time updates.
‚ú® Features
For Users:
Register, login, and manage your profile.
Book rides with options like car, bike, or auto.
Track rides in real-time and see driver details.
Pay with JazzCash (Pakistan-supported gateway).
For Captains:
Register with vehicle details, login, and manage your profile.
Accept/decline ride requests in real-time.
Update your location for better ride matching.
Mark rides as started or completed.
Real-Time Updates:
Instant notifications for ride requests, confirmations, and status changes.
Microservices:
Separate services for User, Captain, Ride, and Map functionalities.
Event-driven communication with RabbitMQ.

üèóÔ∏è Microservices Architecture
Rideo uses a microservices setup to handle different parts of the app independently. Here‚Äôs a quick look:

Services
User Service (http://localhost:3001): Manages user registration, login, and profiles.
Captain Service (http://localhost:3002): Handles captain registration, location updates, and ride acceptance.
Ride Service (http://localhost:3003): Manages ride creation, fare calculation, and status updates.
Map Service (http://localhost:3004): Provides geolocation, distance, and route suggestions.
Socket Server (http://localhost:3000): Powers real-time communication with WebSockets.
Communication
REST APIs: For direct service-to-service calls (e.g., fetching user profile).
RabbitMQ: For async events (e.g., notifying captains of new rides).
WebSockets: For real-time updates (e.g., ride confirmation notifications).
üñ•Ô∏è Frontend Overview
The frontend is built with React and Vite, offering a fast development experience with Hot Module Replacement (HMR). We use Tailwind CSS for styling, GSAP for animations, and React Hook Form for form handling.

Key Pages
User Home (Home.jsx): Where users book rides.
Captain Home (CaptainsHome.jsx): Where captains manage ride requests.
Riding (Riding.jsx): Shows ongoing ride details for users.
Key Components
Below are the main components used in the user flow, with examples for each.

Example: Using LocationSearchPanel Component
This component lets users select their pickup and destination locations.

jsx

 



 
import LocationSearchPanel from "../components/LocationSearchPanel";

const Home  () > {
  const [panelOpen, setPanelOpen]  useState(false);
  const [vehiclePanel, setVehiclePanel]  useState(false);

  return (
    <div>
      <LocationSearchPanel
        setPanelOpen{setPanelOpen}
        setVehiclePanel{setVehiclePanel}
      />
    </div>
  );
};
Output: A panel where users can type "123 Main St" as pickup and "456 Park Ave" as destination.

Example: Using VehicleSuggest Component
This component shows available vehicles with fares and lets users select one.

jsx

 



 
import VehicleSuggest from "../components/VehicleSuggest";

const Home  () > {
  const [confirmPanel, setConfirmPanel]  useState(false);
  const [vehiclePanel, setVehiclePanel]  useState(false);

  return (
    <div>
      <VehicleSuggest
        setConfirmPanel{setConfirmPanel}
        setVehiclePanel{setVehiclePanel}
      />
    </div>
  );
};
Output: A list showing "UberGo (4 seats, PKR 463)", "Moto (1 seat, PKR 233)", and "Auto (3 seats, PKR 303)".

Example: Using ConfirmPanel Component
This component lets users confirm their ride after selecting a vehicle.

jsx

 



 
import ConfirmPanel from "../components/ConfirmPanel";

const Home  () > {
  const [confirmPanel, setConfirmPanel]  useState(false);
  const [vehicleFound, setVehicleFound]  useState(false);

  const createRide  async () > {
    // Logic to create a ride
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <ConfirmPanel
        routes{{ pickupLocation: "123 Main St", destination: "456 Park Ave" }}
        vehicleType"car"
        fare{{ car: 463 }}
        createRide{createRide}
        setConfirmPanel{setConfirmPanel}
        setVehicleFound{setVehicleFound}
      />
    </div>
  );
};
Output: A panel showing ride details (pickup, destination, fare) with a "Confirm Ride" button.

Example: Using DriverLook Component
This component shows driver details after the ride is confirmed.

jsx

 



 
import DriverLook from "../components/DriverLook";

const Home  () > {
  const [vehicleFound, setVehicleFound]  useState(true);
  const ride  {
    captain: { fullName: { firstName: "Jane", lastName: "Doe" } },
    vehicleType: "car",
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <DriverLook ride{ride} setVehicleFound{setVehicleFound} />
    </div>
  );
};
Output: A panel showing "Driver: Jane Doe, Vehicle: Car".

Example: Using WaitDriver Component
This component shows a waiting status while the driver arrives.

jsx

 



 
import WaitDriver from "../components/WaitDriver";

const Home  () > {
  const [waitDriver, setWaitDriver]  useState(true);
  const ride  { id: "64f1a2b3c4d5e6f7g8h9i0j2" };

  return (
    <div>
      <WaitDriver ride{ride} setWaitDriver{setWaitDriver} />
    </div>
  );
};
Output: A message like "Waiting for your driver to arrive...".

‚öôÔ∏è Backend Overview
The backend is split into microservices, each running on a different port. We use Node.js with Express for APIs, MongoDB for data storage, and Mongoose for schema modeling. Authentication is handled with JWT, and real-time updates use Socket.IO.

Key Endpoints and Events
Below are examples for each key API, RabbitMQ event, and WebSocket event.

Usage: The Captain Service subscribes to this event and notifies nearby captains.

Example: WebSocket Event (newRideRequest)
This event notifies captains of a new ride request.

json

 



 
{
  "event": "newRideRequest",
  "ride": {
    "rideId": "64f1a2b3c4d5e6f7g8h9i0j2",

npm start
Test APIs with Postman or curl.
Payments:
Use JazzCash for Pakistan. For testing, you can integrate Stripe (requires a US-based company setup).
Debugging:
Check logs in each service for errors.
Ensure RabbitMQ and MongoDB are running.
